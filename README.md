# ACF Image Set Post Thumbnail

 A simple plugin function to loop through all posts and set an ACF image field as the wordpress default featured image `post-thumbnail`.

 Simply select the post type you wish to run this function on, then select the ACF image field `name` you want to set as the `post-thumbnail`, and click the run button.

 **If ACF image field for current post has no attachment value, the function will skip this post and continue processing.**
