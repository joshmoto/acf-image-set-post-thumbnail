# ACF Image Set Post Thumbnail

A tool function to loop through all posts for specific post_type and set an ACF image field attachment as the Wordpress default `post_thumbnail` (featured image).

Simply select the post type you wish to run this function on, then select the ACF image field `name` you want to set as the `post_thumbnail`, and click run.

**If ACF image field for current post has no attachment value, the function will skip this post and continue processing.**
